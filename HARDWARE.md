# Supported Hardware
This document contains an incomplete list of device and display hardware combinations that have already been tested.

The [release](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/releases) page has builds exclusively for **arm64** and **x64**, but custom builds for other architectures can be made (see [development](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio?tab=readme-ov-file#development)), allowing the application to operate on any hardware.
At least the **minimal** features, such as displaying a **kiosk window** (which doesn't necessarily need to be Home Assistant) will work.

## Hardware
If you are running Linux with a graphical user interface (Wayland or X11), you should be well equipped to use the application. Additionally, any single board computer (SBC) clones of the Raspberry Pi that operate on Raspberry Pi OS **(64-bit)** are likely to function as well.

## Features
**Minimal features** are designed to run on any system without issues:

- A webview kiosk window launched in fullscreen mode and loading the specified `--web-url` website should not cause any problems.
- When connecting to an internal HTTPS site with a self-signed certificate, ensure the specified FQDN matches. Using the `--ignore-certificate-errors` flag is [not recommended](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/76) for browsing external sites.

**Extended features** become available when the `--mqtt-*` arguments are provided and the hardware is supported:

- The following commands are currently implemented to modify the display status. Make sure that one of these works for your display when you run it directly on the terminal, otherwise the MQTT switch will not work either.
  - `wlopm --[on,off] \*` (Raspberry Pi OS, Wayland)
  - `kscreen-doctor --dpms [on,off]` (Debian KDE, Wayland)
  - `xset dpms force [on,off]` (Generic, X11)
- If your hardware is not fully compatible there should be no crashes, but you may miss some sensors.
  - On some Debian based systems (e.g. Ubuntu GNOME), the display status control is only available when using X11 (`xset`).
- There are certain HDMI screens (e.g. Viewsonic) where the display status command doesn't work as expected.
  - The screen [immediately turns on again](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/38), which may be caused by incompatible HDMI cables being used.
- On Raspberry Pi OS the display command may fail with `ERROR: Setting power mode for output '[DSI-*,HDMI-*]' failed`.
  - This can happen if you have `wayvnc` running for remote access and is caused by a [known bug](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/78).
- Certain commands from the MQTT integration may require elevated privileges to work correctly.
  - Ensure that your local user has the [necessary permissions](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/issues/39) to run `sudo` without being prompted for a password.

Hardware support is verified during application startup and can be seen in the terminal or in the log file under the `Supported` section.

## Contributions
In case your hardware is not listed above don't worry, give it a try.
Running `touchkio --web-url=https://demo.home-assistant.io` will most likely just work.
The only problems that may arise are when controlling the display via the Home Assistant integration.
